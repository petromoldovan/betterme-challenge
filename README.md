Dear Team,

thanks for the awesome challenge! I would like to point out few things about the task:
1. I deliberately reset pagination when search or orderBy params are changed. It is better for user experience.
2. Ordering works on stars field but could be easily extended to others.
3. I used create-react-app to save time on setup and concentrate on tasks.
4. I used sass only because it was a requirement. I would normally use the `styled-components` which makes code cleaner.
5. I copied some svgs from the web to make ui nicer. I hope it is ok.
